-- Fix AI Conversation Database Permissions
-- This migration fixes RLS policies and permissions for AI conversations

-- Enable RLS on conversations table if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE conversations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Enable RLS on messages table if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies to avoid conflicts

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own conversations" ON conversations;
