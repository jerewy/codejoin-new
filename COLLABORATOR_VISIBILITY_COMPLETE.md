# Collaborator Visibility Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Solved
After fixing the infinite recursion issue in the RLS policies, collaborators and project admins couldn't see other collaborators on the same project. This fix restores proper collaborator visibility while maintaining the recursion prevention.

## ✅ Status
- [x] Infinite recursion **fixed** (verified by testing)
- [x] Helper functions created (3/4 working)
- [x] Updated RLS policies created
- [ ] Manual execution required for final deployment

## Files Created

### 1. SQL Fix Script
**File**: `fix-collaborator-visibility.sql`
- Complete SQL script to fix collaborator visibility
- Creates 4 helper functions (recursion-safe)
- Implements 7 new RLS policies for collaborators table
- Updates 3 RLS policies for projects table

### 2. Execution Scripts
**File**: `execute-collaborator-visibility-fix.js`
- Attempts to execute SQL fix automatically
- Requires `exec_sql` RPC function (not available)
- Provides manual execution instructions when RPC fails

### 3. Verification Scripts
**File**: `test-collaborator-visibility-after-fix.js`
- Tests infinite recursion prevention
- Verifies helper functions exist
- Checks RLS policy effectiveness
- Validates collaborator visibility logic

## Key Improvements

### New Helper Functions
1. `is_project_owner(project_uuid, user_uuid)` - Safe project ownership check
2. `is_project_admin(project_uuid, user_uuid)` - Safe admin status check
3. `is_project_collaborator(project_uuid, user_uuid)` - **NEW** Direct collaborator check
4. `user_has_any_project_access(project_uuid, user_uuid)` - Comprehensive access check

### Updated RLS Policies

#### Collaborators Table:
1. **collaborators_owners_full_access** - Project owners can see all collaborators
2. **collaborators_admins_view_access** - Project admins can view collaborators
3. **collaborators_admins_insert_access** - Project admins can add collaborators
4. **collaborators_can_view_project_collaborators** - **KEY FIX** - Collaborators can see other collaborators
5. **collaborators_users_view_own_records** - Users can see their own records
6. **collaborators_users_insert_own_records** - Users can insert their own records
7. **collaborators_users_update_own_records** - Users can update their own records

#### Projects Table:
1. **projects_owners_and_admins_full_access** - Full access for owners/admins
2. **projects_collaborators_view_access** - View access for collaborators
3. **projects_public_read_access** - Public read access (disabled)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Project Owners:
- ✅ Can see all collaborators on their projects
- ✅ Can add/remove collaborators
- ✅ Can change collaborator roles
- ✅ Full administrative control

### For Project Admins:
- ✅ Can see all collaborators on projects they admin
- ✅ Can add new collaborators
- ✅ Cannot remove project owners
- ✅ Appropriate administrative permissions

### For Collaborators:
- ✅ **KEY FIX**: Can see other collaborators on the same project
- ✅ Can see project owner and admins
- ✅ Can see their own role and permissions
- ❌ Cannot add/remove other collaborators (security)

### For Regular Users:
- ✅ Can see their own collaborator records
- ❌ Cannot see collaborators on projects they don't have access to

## Manual Execution Required

### Steps to Apply Fix:
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://izngyuhawwlxopcdmfry.supabase.co
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor** in the sidebar
3. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `fix-collaborator-visibility.sql`
4. **Execute the script** by clicking Run
5. **Verify the fix** by running: `node test-collaborator-visibility-after-fix.js`

## Security & Recursion Prevention

### ✅ Recursion-Safe Design:
- Helper functions only query the `projects` table directly
- No circular references between collaborators and projects tables
- All functions marked as `STABLE` and `SECURITY DEFINER`
- No self-referencing policies

### ✅ Security Maintained:
- Proper access control for all user roles
- Collaborators cannot modify other collaborators
- Project owners maintain full control
- Admins have appropriate but limited permissions

## Testing Results

### Current State (Before Manual Execution):
- ✅ Infinite recursion: **FIXED**
- ✅ Helper functions: **3/4 working** (one needs to be created)
- ✅ RLS policies: **Working** (access properly restricted)
- ⚠️ Collaborator visibility: **Needs manual execution**

### Expected State (After Manual Execution):
- ✅ All 4 helper functions working
- ✅ 7 new collaborator policies active
- ✅ 3 updated project policies active
- ✅ Full collaborator visibility restored

## Test Project
**Project ID**: `175a7112-4f23-4160-84ca-893da2cee58b`
Use this project to verify that:
- Project owner sees all collaborators
- Project admins see all collaborators
- Regular collaborators see other collaborators
- Access is properly restricted by role

## Troubleshooting

### If Manual Execution Fails:
1. Check for syntax errors in the SQL script
2. Verify all helper functions are created successfully
3. Ensure RLS is enabled on both tables
4. Test with different user authentication contexts

### Common Issues:
- **Permission denied**: Expected with service key, RLS is working
- **Function does not exist**: Helper functions need to be created
- **Policy not found**: Policies need to be applied manually

## Next Steps

1. **Execute the SQL fix manually** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Run verification script** to confirm the fix works
3. **Test with actual users** in the application
4. **Monitor for any performance issues**
5. **Document the fix** for future reference

The fix is ready for deployment and should restore full collaborator visibility while maintaining security and preventing infinite recursion.
