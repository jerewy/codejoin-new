# Database Schema Optimization Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive recommendations for optimizing the database schema to resolve the `project_id` ambiguity error and improve overall performance, maintainability, and scalability of the Team Chat functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `column reference "project_id" is ambiguous` error (PostgreSQL error 42702) occurs when SQL queries involve JOINs between multiple tables that each contain a `project_id` column. PostgreSQL cannot determine which table's `project_id` column is being referenced without explicit qualification.

### Affected Tables with `project_id` Columns:
1. **`activities`** - `project_id` (nullable)
2. **`collaborators`** - `project_id` (foreign key to projects.id)
3. **`conversations`** - `project_id` (nullable, foreign key to projects.id)
4. **`project_nodes`** - `project_id` (foreign key to projects.id)
5. **`projects`** - `id` (primary key, referenced as project_id in other tables)

### Problematic Query Patterns:
- Complex JOINs between `conversations`, `projects`, and `collaborators`
- RLS policies that reference multiple tables with shared column names
- Views that aggregate data across multiple tables with `project_id` columns

## Immediate Solutions Implemented

### 1. SQL Query Fixes

**File**: `fix-project-id-ambiguity.sql`

âœ… **Fixed ai_conversation_analytics View**:
```sql
-- Before (ambiguous):
SELECT c.id, project_id, c.title, ...
FROM conversations c LEFT JOIN messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id

-- After (qualified):
SELECT c.id, c.project_id, c.title, ...
FROM conversations c LEFT JOIN messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id
```

âœ… **Created Safe Query Functions**:
- `get_project_conversations_safe(project_id, conversation_type)`
- `get_conversation_with_messages_safe(conversation_id)`
- `get_project_activity_safe(project_id, limit)`

âœ… **Updated RLS Policies**:
- All column references now use explicit table qualifications
- Policies use EXISTS subqueries with qualified column names
- Improved error handling and security

### 2. Application Layer Fixes

**File**: `lib/database-query-builder.ts`

âœ… **Safe Query Builder Class**:
- Uses explicit table aliases in all queries
- Prevents column ambiguity through qualified references
- Comprehensive error handling for PostgreSQL error codes

âœ… **Database Error Handler**:
- Specific handling for ambiguity errors (42702)
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

**File**: `lib/ai-conversation-service-fixed.ts`

âœ… **Fixed AI Conversation Service**:
- Uses safe query builder for all operations
- Proper validation and error handling
- Batch operations for better performance

## Long-Term Schema Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Normalization Improvements

#### Current Schema Issues:
- `activities.project_id` is nullable (data integrity issue)
- `conversations.project_id` is nullable (should be required for non-system conversations)
- Missing foreign key constraints in some relationships
- Inconsistent naming conventions

#### Recommended Changes:

```sql
-- 1. Make project_id NOT NULL where appropriate
ALTER TABLE conversations
ALTER COLUMN project_id SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE activities
ALTER COLUMN project_id SET NOT NULL;

-- 2. Add missing foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE conversations
ADD CONSTRAINT conversations_project_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE activities
ADD CONSTRAINT activities_project_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 3. Add check constraints for data validation
ALTER TABLE conversations
ADD CONSTRAINT conversations_type_check
CHECK (type IN ('ai-chat', 'team-chat', 'system'));

ALTER TABLE messages
ADD CONSTRAINT messages_role_check
CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant', 'system', 'tool'));
```

### 2. Index Optimization Strategy

#### Current Indexes (Good):
```sql
-- Already created in fix-project-id-ambiguity.sql
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_project_id_created ON conversations(project_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_project_type_updated ON conversations(project_id, type, updated_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_id_created ON messages(conversation_id, created_at ASC);
CREATE INDEX idx_collaborators_project_user ON collaborators(project_id, user_id);
```

#### Additional Recommended Indexes:

```sql
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_project_created_by ON conversations(project_id, created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_role_created ON messages(conversation_id, role, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_project_type_created ON activities(project_id, activity_type, created_at DESC);

-- Partial indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_active_ai_conversations ON conversations(project_id, updated_at DESC)
WHERE type = 'ai-chat' AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

CREATE INDEX idx_recent_messages ON messages(conversation_id, created_at DESC)
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- JSON indexes for metadata queries
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_metadata_type ON conversations USING GIN ((metadata->>'type'));
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_metadata_model ON messages USING GIN ((metadata->>'model'));
```

### 3. Partitioning Strategy for Scale

#### Recommended Partitioning for Large Tables:

```sql
-- Partition conversations by project_id for large deployments
CREATE TABLE conversations_partitioned (
    LIKE conversations INCLUDING ALL
) PARTITION BY HASH (project_id);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE conversations_part_0 PARTITION OF conversations_partitioned FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 0);
CREATE TABLE conversations_part_1 PARTITION OF conversations_partitioned FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 1);
CREATE TABLE conversations_part_2 PARTITION OF conversations_partitioned FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);
CREATE TABLE conversations_part_3 PARTITION OF conversations_partitioned FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);

-- Partition messages by conversation_id for time-based queries
CREATE TABLE messages_partitioned (
    LIKE messages INCLUDING ALL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Monthly partitions for messages
CREATE TABLE messages_2024_01 PARTITION OF messages_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring

#### Recommended Monitoring Queries:

```sql
-- Monitor slow queries involving project_id
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%project_id%'
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Monitor index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('conversations', 'messages', 'collaborators', 'activities')
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Monitor table sizes
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size,
    pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) as size_bytes
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('conversations', 'messages', 'collaborators', 'activities', 'projects')
ORDER BY size_bytes DESC;
```

### 5. Query Optimization Patterns

#### Best Practices for Application Development:

1. **Always Use Table Aliases**:
   ```sql
   -- Bad: SELECT id, project_id FROM conversations JOIN projects ON conversations.project_id = projects.id
   -- Good: SELECT c.id, c.project_id FROM conversations c JOIN projects p ON c.project_id = p.id
   ```

2. **Qualify Column Names in JOINs**:
   ```sql
   -- Bad: WHERE project_id = ?
   -- Good: WHERE conversations.project_id = ?
   ```

3. **Use Explicit Foreign Key Relationships**:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase queries
   .select('*, project:projects!conversations_project_id_fkey(id, name)')
   ```

4. **Implement Proper Error Handling**:
   ```typescript
   if (DatabaseErrorHandler.isAmbiguityError(error)) {
     // Handle specific ambiguity errors
   }
   ```

### 6. Data Archival Strategy

#### Recommended Archival Policies:

```sql
-- Archive old conversations (older than 1 year)
CREATE TABLE conversations_archive AS
SELECT * FROM conversations
WHERE updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Archive old messages (older than 6 months)
CREATE TABLE messages_archive AS
SELECT * FROM messages
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';

-- Delete archived records from main tables
DELETE FROM messages WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
DELETE FROM conversations WHERE updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
```
