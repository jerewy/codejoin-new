-- PROJECT_ID AMBIGUITY FIX - Comprehensive Solution
-- ================================================================
-- This script fixes the "column reference project_id is ambiguous" error
-- by properly qualifying column references in complex JOIN operations.
--
-- Root Cause: Multiple tables have project_id columns and when JOINed,
-- PostgreSQL cannot distinguish which table's project_id is referenced.
--
-- Solution: Explicit table aliases and qualified column references
-- ================================================================

-- ================================================================
-- STEP 1: IDENTIFY AMBIGUOUS QUERIES
-- ================================================================

\echo 'üîç Identifying queries with project_id ambiguity issues...'

-- Common problematic patterns that cause ambiguity:
-- 1. conversations JOIN projects JOIN collaborators
-- 2. activities JOIN projects JOIN collaborators
-- 3. Complex RLS policies that reference multiple tables with project_id

-- View definition that may have ambiguity (ai_conversation_analytics)
\echo 'üìä Checking current view definitions for ambiguity...'

SELECT
    'VIEW_ANALYSIS' as step,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views
WHERE viewname = 'ai_conversation_analytics';

-- STEP 2: FIX AI_CONVERSATION_ANALYTICS VIEW
