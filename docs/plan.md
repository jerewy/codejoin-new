## Quick Notes & Gotchas

- **API Key:** Use `test123` for development testing
- **Docker Images:** Run `npm run docker:build` to rebuild all containers
- **TypeScript:** Requires Node.js 18+ and proper ts-node configuration
- **SQL:** Uses printf instead of here-documents due to quote sensitivity
- **Go:** Needs higher ulimits (256 file descriptors, 128 processes)
- **Testing:** Run `node test-all-languages.js` for comprehensive validation
- **Common Error:** 401 Unauthorized means wrong API key in test scripts

## Architecture Choices (for learning)

- **Container Runtime:** Docker with security isolation - Prevents code execution from affecting host
- **Authentication:** API key-based with middleware - Simple but effective for development
- **Language Support:** Multi-language container + specialized images - Balance between efficiency and compatibility
- **Framework:** Express.js with middleware pattern - Easy to extend and maintain
- **Security:** No network access, resource limits, non-root user - Defense in depth approach

- Test all languages: Run comprehensive test suite weekly

<!-- Examples:
Docker: docker system prune, docker system df
Node.js: npm cache clean --force, du -sh node_modules
Python: pip cache purge, du -sh venv
General: clean temp files, check project folder size
-->
