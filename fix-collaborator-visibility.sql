-- COLLABORATOR VISIBILITY FIX - UPDATED RLS POLICIES
-- ================================================================
-- This script fixes the collaborator visibility issue while maintaining
-- the infinite recursion fix. It ensures that:
-- 1. Project owners can see all collaborators
-- 2. Project admins can see all collaborators on projects they admin
-- 3. Collaborators can see other collaborators on projects they have access to
-- 4. Users can see their own collaborator records
--
-- Created: 2025-10-06
-- Purpose: Fix collaborator visibility without re-introducing recursion
