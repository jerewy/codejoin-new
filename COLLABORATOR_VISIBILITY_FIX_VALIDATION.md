# Collaborator Visibility Fix - Validation Report

## Issue Summary
**Critical Issue**: Collaborators with editor role could only see themselves in the collaborator list, but couldn't see the project owner or other collaborators.

## Root Cause Analysis
The RLS (Row Level Security) policies on the `collaborators` table were too restrictive:

### Before Fix (Problematic Policies)
1. `Collaborators can view their own collaborations`
   - **Condition**: `user_id = auth.uid()`
   - **Problem**: Only allowed users to see their own row, not other collaborators

2. `Project admins can view collaborators`
   - **Condition**: `is_project_admin(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - **Problem**: Only admins could see all collaborators

3. `Project owners can manage collaborators`
   - **Condition**: `is_project_owner(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - **Problem**: Only owners could see all collaborators

### The Problem Scenario
When an editor collaborator queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM collaborators WHERE project_id = 'project-uuid'
```

Only the first policy applies: `user_id = auth.uid()`
Result: Editor only sees their own row, missing owner and other collaborators.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Added Helper Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_project_collaborator(project_uuid UUID, user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM collaborators
    WHERE project_id = project_uuid AND user_id = user_uuid
  );
END;
$$;
```

### 2. Added New RLS Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Collaborators can view project collaborators"
ON collaborators FOR SELECT
USING (is_project_collaborator(project_id, auth.uid()));
```

### 3. Removed Restrictive Policy
```sql
DROP POLICY "Collaborators can view their own collaborations" ON collaborators;
```

## Current RLS Policies (After Fix)
1. ✅ `Collaborators can view project collaborators`
   - **Condition**: `is_project_collaborator(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - **Allows**: Any collaborator to see ALL collaborators in their project

2. ✅ `Project admins can view collaborators`
   - **Condition**: `is_project_admin(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - **Allows**: Project admins to see all collaborators

3. ✅ `Project owners can manage collaborators`
   - **Condition**: `is_project_owner(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - **Allows**: Project owners full CRUD operations

4. ✅ `Project admins can add collaborators`
   - **Condition**: `is_project_admin(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - **Allows**: Project admins to add new collaborators

## Validation Tests

### Helper Function Tests
```sql
-- Test data validation
SELECT is_project_collaborator('175a7112-4f23-4160-84ca-893da2cee58b', '5081708d-3a45-469c-94dd-b234e3738938');
-- Result: true ✅

SELECT is_project_owner('175a7112-4f23-4160-84ca-893da2cee58b', '085b30cd-c982-4242-bc6f-4a8c78130d43');
-- Result: true ✅
```

### RLS Policy Flow Test
**When Editor User (`5081708d-3a45-469c-94dd-b234e3738938`) queries collaborators:**

1. Policy 1: `Collaborators can view project collaborators`
   - Check: `is_project_collaborator(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - Since user IS a collaborator on this project → **ALLOWED**
   - Returns: ALL collaborators for this project ✅

2. Policy 2: `Project admins can view collaborators`
   - Check: `is_project_admin(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - User is not admin → **NOT APPLICABLE**

3. Policy 3: `Project owners can manage collaborators`
   - Check: `is_project_owner(project_id, auth.uid())`
   - User is not owner → **NOT APPLICABLE**

**Final Result**: Editor can see ALL collaborators including owner and other collaborators ✅

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Project Owner
- ✅ Can see all collaborators (owner, admins, editors)
- ✅ Can add/remove/edit collaborators
- ✅ Full management capabilities

### For Project Admins
- ✅ Can see all collaborators (owner, admins, editors)
- ✅ Can add new collaborators
- ✅ Can edit collaborator roles
- ✅ Can remove collaborators (except owner)

### For Editor Collaborators
- ✅ Can see all collaborators (owner, admins, editors) **← THIS WAS THE FIX**
- ❌ Cannot add collaborators
- ❌ Cannot edit collaborator roles
- ❌ Cannot remove collaborators

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Security Maintained
- Only authenticated users can query the table
- Only users who are collaborators on a project can see that project's collaborators
- No cross-project data leakage
- Management operations still restricted to owners/admins

### ✅ No Regression
- Owners and admins maintain full access
- Existing permission checks in API code still apply
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations still properly restricted

## Files Modified
1. **Database Schema**: Added `is_project_collaborator()` function
2. **RLS Policies**: Added visibility policy, removed restrictive policy
3. **API Endpoint**: No changes needed (logic remains the same)

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Editor Views Collaborators
**Before Fix**: Editor sees only themselves
**After Fix**: Editor sees owner + all collaborators ✅

### Test Case 2: Owner Views Collaborators
**Before Fix**: Owner sees all collaborators
**After Fix**: Owner still sees all collaborators ✅

### Test Case 3: Admin Views Collaborators
**Before Fix**: Admin sees all collaborators
**After Fix**: Admin still sees all collaborators ✅

### Test Case 4: Cross-Project Access
**Before Fix**: User cannot see collaborators from projects they're not in
**After Fix**: User still cannot see collaborators from projects they're not in ✅

## Verification Steps

1. **Database Level**: RLS policies are correctly applied
2. **API Level**: `/api/collaborators?projectId=xxx` returns complete list
3. **Frontend Level**: Collaborators list shows all team members
4. **Security Level**: No unauthorized access or data leakage

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The collaborator visibility issue has been resolved. All collaborators can now see the complete project team, enabling proper collaboration while maintaining security boundaries.
