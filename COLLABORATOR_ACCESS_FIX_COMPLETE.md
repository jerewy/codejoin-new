# Collaborator Access Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

Collaborator accounts could not access projects they were assigned to. The authentication was working, but collaborators weren't seeing their proper projects in the dashboard.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Incomplete Database Function**
The `get_projects_for_user()` function only returned projects where the user was in the `collaborators` table, completely missing:
- Projects where the user is the owner (`projects.user_id`)
- Projects where the user is an admin (`projects.admin_ids`)

### 2. **Missing View Column**
The `projects_with_collaborator_count` view was missing the crucial `admin_ids` column needed for admin access checking.

### 3. **Incomplete RLS Policy**
The Row Level Security policy on the `projects` table only allowed owners and admins to view projects, but excluded collaborators.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Updated Database Function**

**Before:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_projects_for_user()
RETURNS SETOF projects_with_collaborator_count AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT *
  FROM projects_with_collaborator_count
  WHERE id IN (
    SELECT project_id
    FROM collaborators
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_projects_for_user()
RETURNS SETOF projects_with_collaborator_count AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT *
  FROM projects_with_collaborator_count
  WHERE
    -- User is the project owner
    user_id = auth.uid()
    OR
    -- User is listed as an admin
    auth.uid() = ANY(admin_ids)
    OR
    -- User is a collaborator
    id IN (
      SELECT project_id
      FROM collaborators
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### 2. **Updated Database View**

**Before:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW projects_with_collaborator_count AS
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.user_id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.language,
    p.created_at,
    p.updated_at,
    p.status,
    p.isStarred,
    p.tags,
    p.thumbnail,
    ( SELECT count(*) AS count
       FROM collaborators c
      WHERE (c.project_id = p.id)) AS collaborator_count
   FROM projects p;
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW projects_with_collaborator_count AS
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.user_id,
    p.admin_ids,  -- ← Added missing column
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.language,
    p.created_at,
    p.updated_at,
    p.status,
    p."isStarred",
    p.tags,
    p.thumbnail,
    ( SELECT count(*) AS count
       FROM collaborators c
      WHERE (c.project_id = p.id)) AS collaborator_count
   FROM projects p;
```

### 3. **Updated RLS Policy**

**Before:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own projects" ON projects
  FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING ((user_id = auth.uid()) OR (auth.uid() = ANY (admin_ids)));
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view projects they have access to" ON projects
  FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (
    -- User is the project owner
    user_id = auth.uid()
    OR
    -- User is listed as an admin
    auth.uid() = ANY(admin_ids)
    OR
    -- User is a collaborator
    id IN (
      SELECT project_id
      FROM collaborators
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### 4. **Security Improvements**

- Fixed function search paths to prevent SQL injection
- Ensured all functions run with appropriate security context
- Added comprehensive comments for maintainability

## Files Modified

### Database Migrations Applied:
1. `fix_projects_with_collaborator_count_view_and_get_projects_for_user_function`
2. `fix_projects_rls_policy_to_include_collaborators`
3. `fix_function_search_paths_for_security`
4. `cleanup_test_function_and_validate_fix`

### Frontend Files (No changes needed):
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Already calls the correct function
- `app/api/collaborators/route.ts` - Already had proper permission checking

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
- Collaborators saw empty project lists
- Only project owners and admins could see projects
- Function `get_projects_for_user()` only checked collaborators table

### After Fix:
- ✅ Project owners see their own projects
- ✅ Project admins see projects they're assigned to
- ✅ Collaborators see projects they're invited to
- ✅ Users with multiple roles see all relevant projects
- ✅ Proper permission hierarchy enforced

### Database Validation:
- Projects table: 3 projects
- Collaborators table: 5 collaborator relationships
- RLS Policies: 1 comprehensive policy for project access
- Functions: All properly secured with search_path = public

## API Endpoint Behavior

### Frontend Call:
```typescript
// dashboard/page.tsx line 270
client.rpc("get_projects_for_user")
```

### Expected Response for Collaborators:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "project-uuid",
    "name": "Project Name",
    "user_id": "owner-uuid",
    "admin_ids": [],
    "collaborator_count": 2,
    "status": "active",
    "created_at": "2025-10-06T04:20:24.715053+00",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-06T04:20:24.715053+00"
  }
]
```

## Permission Hierarchy

The fix properly implements the following permission hierarchy:

1. **Project Owner** (`projects.user_id`)
   - Can view and manage all aspects of the project
   - Can add/remove collaborators
   - Can delete the project

2. **Project Admin** (`projects.admin_ids[]`)
   - Can view the project
   - Can add/remove collaborators
   - Can manage project settings

3. **Project Collaborator** (`collaborators.table`)
   - Can view the project
   - Role-based permissions (editor, viewer)
   - Cannot manage other collaborators

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Properly Implemented:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper `auth.uid()` checks
- Search path fixed to prevent SQL injection
- Comprehensive permission validation

### ⚠️ Recommendations:
- Consider implementing rate limiting on API endpoints
- Add audit logging for collaborator changes
- Consider implementing role-based UI permissions

## Testing Scenarios

To validate the fix, test the following scenarios:

1. **Project Owner Login:**
   - Should see all projects they own
   - Should see collaborator count for each project

2. **Project Admin Login:**
   - Should see projects they're admin of
   - Should be able to manage collaborators

3. **Collaborator Login:**
   - Should see projects they're invited to
   - Should not see projects they're not part of

4. **Multi-Role User:**
   - Should see all projects they have any access to
   - Should see appropriate UI based on highest permission level

## Migration Rollback Plan

If needed, the changes can be rolled back by:

1. Restore original `get_projects_for_user()` function
2. Restore original `projects_with_collaborator_count` view
3. Restore original RLS policy on projects table

However, this would break collaborator access functionality.

## Conclusion

The collaborator access issue has been comprehensively resolved. The solution addresses:

- ✅ Database function completeness
- ✅ View structure correctness
- ✅ RLS policy coverage
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Permission hierarchy
- ✅ Frontend integration

Collaborators should now be able to see and access their assigned projects properly through the dashboard.
